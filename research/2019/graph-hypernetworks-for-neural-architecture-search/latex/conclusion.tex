\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we propose the Graph HyperNetwork (GHN), a composition of graph neural networks and
hypernetworks that generates the weights of any architecture by operating directly on their
computation graph representation. We demonstrate a strong correlation between the performance with
the generated weights and the fully-trained weights. Using our GHN to form a surrogate search
signal, we achieve competitive results on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet mobile with nearly 10$\times$ faster
speed compared to other random search methods. Furthermore, we show that our proposed method can be
extended to outperform the best human-designed architectures in setting of anytime prediction,
greatly reducing the computation cost of real-time neural networks.
