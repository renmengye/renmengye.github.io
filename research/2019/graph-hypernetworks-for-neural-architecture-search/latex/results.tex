\section{Experiments}
In this section, we use our proposed GHN to search for the best CNN architecture for image
classification. First, we evaluate the GHN on the standard CIFAR \citep{krizhevsky2009cifar} and
ImageNet \citep{russakovsky2015imagenet} architecture search benchmarks. Next, we apply GHN on an
``anytime prediction'' task where we optimize the speed-accuracy tradeoff that is key for many
real-time applications. Finally, we benchmark the GHN's  predicted-performance correlation and
explore various factors in an ablation study.
