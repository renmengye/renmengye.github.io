\caption{Visualization of example features and attractors using t-SNE. This plot shows a 5-way
5-shot episode on \textit{mini}-ImageNet. 512-dimensional feature vectors and attractor vectors
are projected to a 2-dim space. Color represents the label class of the example. The static
attractor (\textcolor{teal}{teal}) appears at the center of the attention attractors, which roughly
form clusters based on the classes.}
