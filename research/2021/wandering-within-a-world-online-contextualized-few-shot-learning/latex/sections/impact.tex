\section*{Broader Impact}
\vspace{-0.1in}
Our work aims to bridge the gap between machine learning and human learning in terms of the
adaptibility at test time of recognizing novel objects. Potential applications include more
personalized assistive technology and general home robotics. For example, as the society ages, the
population needs additional caregiving at home, but this option is currently not available to
everyone. Having a robot that can cook and do laundry at home can greatly alleviate the burden to
many people. We also note that while our intention is good, just like all technologies, the
algorithm we develop can also bring disadvantages to certain groups, for example, people who cannot
afford products sold by companies that have put in their resources to commercialize the
technological advances made by us, and people or facilities that are targeted by autonomous
surveillance and weapons. Whether the potential impact is positive or negative is unclear to us and
we would like to leave it open to debate.
