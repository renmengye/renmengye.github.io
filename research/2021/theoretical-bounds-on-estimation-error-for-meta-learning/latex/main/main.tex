%\section*{Broader Impact}
%Our work focuses primarily on sample complexity bounds for meta learning. It is difficult to assess the societal impact of theoretical research but our hope is to drive fundamental improvements to meta-learning and this will certainly have significant societal impact. Meta-learning researchers seek to create more general, data-efficient, and robust learning algorithms. On one hand, improved data efficiency empowers groups without access to large datasets to utilize machine learning methods; for example language models for less common written/spoken languages. But these improvements are largely applicable to other settings we may not target as researchers; such as military and surveillance applications where novel distributions and limited data are common-place.
