\section{Conclusion}

In this work, we propose a novel semi-supervised few-shot learning paradigm, where an unlabeled set
is added to each episode. We also extend the setup to more realistic situations where the unlabeled
set has classes not belonging to the labeled classes. To address the problem that current few-shot
classification dataset is too small for a labeled vs.\ unlabeled split and does not have
hierarchical levels of labels, we also introduce a new dataset, \textit{tiered}ImageNet. We propose
several novel extensions of Prototypical Networks, and they show consistent improvements under 
semi-supervised settings compared to our baselines. As future work, we are working on incorporating 
fast weights \citep{ba2016fw,FinnC2017} into our framework so that examples can have different
embedding representation given the contents in the episode.
