Suppose $G$, $f_i$ and $\alpha_t$ satisfy the aforementioned conditions, then
Algorithm~\ref{alg:ad} achieves $\EE{\lVert \nabla G(\theta_t) \rVert^2} \leq \epsilon$ in
$O(1/\epsilon^2)$ steps. More specifically,
\begin{align}
\min\limits_{0 < t < T} \EE{\lVert \nabla G(\theta_t) \rVert^2} \leq \frac{C}{\sqrt{T}},
\end{align}
where $C$ is some constant independent of the convergence process.
