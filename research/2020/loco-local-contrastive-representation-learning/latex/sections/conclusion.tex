\section{Conclusion}
We have presented {\ours}, a local learning algorithm for unsupervised contrastive learning. We show
that by introducing implicit gradient feedback between the gradient isolation blocks and properly
deepening the decoders, we can largely close the gap between local contrastive learning and
state-of-the-art end-to-end contrastive learning frameworks. Experiments on ImageNet and downstream
tasks show that {\ours} can learn good visual representations for both object recognition and
instance segmentation just like end-to-end approaches can. Meanwhile, it can benefit from nice
properties of local learning, such as lower peak memory footprint and faster model parallel
training.
