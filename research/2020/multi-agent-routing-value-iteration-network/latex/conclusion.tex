\section{Conclusion}

In this paper we proposed a novel approach to perform online routing of a swarm of agents in the
realistic domain where dynamic challenges are present. By making use of learned value iteration
transitions and an attention based communication protocol, our model is able to outperform the
state-of-the-art on real road graphs. Furthermore, it is able to do so in a scalable manner and can generalize well to different number of agents and nodes without re-training.
%trained using graphs of 25 nodes and two agents, it can generalize to much larger graphs with more than five agents.
Future work include performing a more in-depth analysis on the
information encoded in the communication and its semantic meaning.
There is also future exploration to be done into techniques to enable this system to run on massive
graphs, as the
memory usage during evaluation is still $O(n^2)$ due to the pairwise adjacency matrix.
